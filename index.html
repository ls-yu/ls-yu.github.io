        <h1>Hi, I'm Lex!</h1>
        <p>
            <span>My name is <strong>Lex Yu</strong> and I'm an undergraduate at the <strong>University of Southern California</strong> studying</span> 
            <span id="major" onclick="toggleMajorText()">Computer Science (Games)</span>
            <span id="major-description"> an interdisciplinary program that includes the curriculum of the standard CS major, plus game design and game programming classes.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>Below are some projects I've worked on! (For my employment/everything resume, please email me at lsyu@usc.edu.)</span>
        </p>
        
        <h3 class="project-links"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1637610/Time_Tails/">Time Tails</a></h4>

            <br>
            <span>I worked on Time Tails during my internship at Snowbright Studio! Time Tails is a kids 2D point and click adventure partially funded by the US Dept. of Education, and it includes history lessons and teaches players about some basic features of the Unity engine. I translated wireframes into Unity scenes, and programmed three of the levels, including integrating a pre existing dialogue system into the levels which involved reading documentation for that system. I also programmed the menus and conclusion sequence. (Unity/C#)</span>

        <h3 class="project-links"><a href="https://lynnfactor.itch.io/ourfirstkiss">Our First Kiss</a></h4>

            <img src="assets/img/ourfirstkiss.png" alt="Our first kiss start screen" class="wide-img">
            <br>
            <span>I was the primary programmer on Our First Kiss, another students' Masters Thesis project (Unity/C#, I did software only). It's a festival (or you can play it at home with a friend or partner) game about performing affection and wordlessly communicating to time your first kiss at a movie date! I programmed the kissing mechanic, the color saturation and music/film clip changes, the keyboard controls remapping, the accessories selection, the ending, and I debugged the movement code.</span>

        <h3>Smaller Projects:</h3>
        <h4 class="project-links"><a href="https://lsyu.itch.io/color-combine">Color Combine</a></h4>
        <p>
            <img src="assets/img/colorcombine.png" alt="Color combine image" class="square-img">
            <br>
            <span>I made this alone in half a day in Unity, it was inspired by the Home Depot color sample section and also by my slight fear of outer space. You click and combine a bunch of differently colored blobs, whose color gets averaged when you combine them, until you've combined all of them and end with a final color. The blobs are randomly scattered throughout the space, and many are offscreen (there's a box that tells you where your cursor is in space so you don't get lost, and hints in case you can't find the next blob.)</span>
        </p>
        <h4 class="project-links"><a href="https://lsyu.itch.io/good-night-egg">Good Night, Egg</a></h4>
        <p>
            <img src="assets/img/goodnightegg.png" alt="Good Night Egge image" class="square-img">
            <br>
            <span>This was my first Unity game that I made alone as an optional class project, basically a 2D simulator of a genderqueer teen checking their phone before bedtime.</span>
