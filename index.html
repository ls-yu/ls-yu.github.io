        <h1>Hi, I'm Lex!</h1>
        <p>
            <span>My name is <strong>Lex Yu</strong> and I'm an undergraduate at the <strong>University of Southern California</strong> studying</span> 
            <span id="major" onclick="toggleMajorText()">Computer Science (Games)</span>
            <span id="major-description" display="none"> an interdisciplinary program that includes the curriculum of the standard CS major, plus game design and game programming classes.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span>Below are some projects I've worked on! (For my employment/everything resume, please email me at lsyu@usc.edu.)</span>
        </p>

            <br>
            <span>I worked on Time Tails during my internship at Snowbright Studio! I programmed two of the levels, the menus, and the outro (Unity/C#). Time Tails is a kids 2D point and click adventure partially funded by the US Dept. of Education, and it includes history lessons and teaches players some basic features of the Unity engine.</span>

            <br>
            <span>I was the primary programmer on Our First Kiss, another students' Masters Thesis project (Unity/C#, I did software only). It's a festival (or you can play it at home with a friend or partner) game about performing affection and wordlessly communicating to time your first kiss at a movie date! I programmed the kissing mechanic, the color saturation and music/film clip changes, the keyboard controls remapping, the accessories selection, and the ending.</span>
